### **Code Level Security**
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**:  
  Checks for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**:  
  Identifies security issues within the code itself.

### **Post-Deployment Security**
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**:  
  Tests the running application for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks.

## **Understanding CVE in Cybersecurity**

### **CVE Definition**
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**:  
  A standardized system that assigns unique IDs to publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

### **Origin and Purpose**
- **Founded in 1999** by the **MITRE Corporation**.  
  Funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
  Facilitates standardized communication and tracking of vulnerabilities.

### **How CVE Works**
- Each CVE has:
  - A **unique identifier** (e.g., CVE-YYYY-NNNNN).
  - A brief **description** of the vulnerability.
  - **References** to additional resources.

### **Criteria for Inclusion**
1. **Independently Fixable**: Resolvable without addressing other issues.  
2. **Vendor Acknowledgment**: Recognized by the vendor as a security flaw.  
3. **Single Codebase Impact**: Affects a specific software or product.

### **Importance of CVE**
- **Facilitates Communication**: Standardized IDs simplify discussions.  
- **Enhances Security Management**: Helps prioritize and address vulnerabilities.  
- **Supports Risk Management**: Tools reference CVEs for automated detection.

### **Key CVE Resources**
1. **MITRE CVE Database**: The primary source for CVEs.  
2. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: Provides enriched details like severity scores.  
3. **CVE Details**: Offers exploits, tools, and additional advisory links.  
4. **Vendor Databases**: Tailored CVE data for specific products.

## **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)**

### **Overview**
- A nonprofit organization founded in **2001**, aimed at improving software security.
- Offers free, community-driven resources and tools for secure application development.

### **Key Initiatives**
1. **OWASP Top 10**:  
   Lists the most critical web application security risks.  
   Example: SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
2. **Community-driven**:  
   Open collaboration for innovation and shared knowledge.
3. **Free Resources**:  
   All tools and documentation are accessible to the public.  
4. **Global Reach**:  
   Over **250 local chapters worldwide** promoting security awareness.

### **Mission and Vision**
- **Mission**: Empower organizations to develop secure software through education, tools, and best practices.  
- **Vision**: Eliminate insecure software by addressing key vulnerabilities.
